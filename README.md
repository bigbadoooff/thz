This is a custom component to connect a Stiebel Eltron LWZ or Tecalor THZ Heat Pump to Homeassistant.
Connection is made either with USB or ser.net

It is based on the respective FHEM-Module by Immi.

I neither claim that it will work nor that it's safe to use but until now my heatpump didn't explode.

Feel free to try it out and give me
