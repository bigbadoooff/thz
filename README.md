## Introduction

This is a custom Home Assistant integration for connecting Stiebel Eltron LWZ or Tecalor THZ heat pumps to Home Assistant. The integration enables comprehensive monitoring and control of your heat pump system directly from your Home Assistant instance.

The integration communicates with the heat pump using the serial protocol, supporting both direct USB connections and network-based serial connections (via ser2net). This allows flexible deployment options depending on your home automation setup.

**Origin**: This integration is based on the FHEM-Module developed by Immi, adapted for Home Assistant with modern async architecture and full UI configuration support.

**V0.2 is a big release that fixes most of the known errors. A few translation strings are still missing and some sensor values are off either in unit or in size. I will fix that one by one.**

## Features

### Currently Implemented

- ✅ **Full UI Configuration**: Easy setup through Home Assistant's integration interface - no YAML configuration required
- ✅ **Connection Options**: Support for both USB serial and network (ser2net) connections
- ✅ **Sensor Platform**: Monitor various heat pump parameters (temperatures, pressures, operating states, etc.)
- ✅ **Switch Platform**: Control heat pump functions on/off
- ✅ **Number Platform**: Adjust numeric settings and parameters
- ✅ **Select Platform**: Choose between predefined options for various settings
- ✅ **Time Platform**: Set time-based parameters, schedules and programs
- ✅ **Device Registry Integration**: Proper device identification in Home Assistant
- ✅ **Automatic Polling**: Regular updates of sensor values
- ✅ **Smart Entity Management**: Non-essential entities are hidden by default to reduce clutter

### Hidden Entities by Default

To provide a cleaner initial setup experience, the following entity types are hidden by default:

- **HC2 (Heating Circuit 2) entities**: Only needed if you have a second heating circuit installed
- **Time plan/program entities**: Advanced schedule configuration entities (programDHW_*, programHC1_*, programHC2_*)
- **Advanced technical parameters**: Parameters like gradient, hysteresis, integral components (typically p13 and higher)

**Note**: Hidden entities can still be manually enabled through the Home Assistant UI:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Find the THZ integration and click on it
3. Click on the device
4. Click "Show disabled entities" at the bottom
5. Enable any entities you need

### COP (Coefficient of Performance) Sensors

For firmware versions that support energy monitoring (e.g., 4.39), the integration automatically provides COP sensors:

#### Automatically Created Sensors

- **Current COP**: Real-time COP based on instantaneous power measurements
- **Daily COP DHW**: Daily COP for domestic hot water
- **Daily COP Heating**: Daily COP for heating circuit
- **Daily COP Total**: Combined daily COP (DHW + Heating)
- **Monthly COP DHW**: Monthly COP for domestic hot water
- **Monthly COP Heating**: Monthly COP for heating circuit
- **Monthly COP Total**: Combined monthly COP (DHW + Heating)
- **Yearly COP DHW**: Yearly COP for domestic hot water
- **Yearly COP Heating**: Yearly COP for heating circuit
- **Yearly COP Total**: Combined yearly COP (DHW + Heating)
- **Lifetime COP DHW**: Overall COP for DHW since installation
- **Lifetime COP Heating**: Overall COP for heating since installation
- **Lifetime COP Total**: Combined lifetime COP (DHW + Heating)

**Note**: COP (Coefficient of Performance) is calculated as Heat Output ÷ Electrical Input. A COP of 3.0 means the heat pump produces 3 kW of heat for every 1 kW of electricity consumed. 

Monthly and Yearly COP sensors automatically reset at the start of each month/year and track the performance for that period. They persist their state across Home Assistant restarts.

COP sensors require energy sensors to be available on your device, typically present in firmware 4.39 and higher.

### Planned Features

- 🔄 make sure all Sensor values are interpreted correctly
- 🔄 Improve Settings for Polling Frequency from the Device
- 🔄 create climate entities for smoother interaction

## Compatibility

### Confirmed Working Devices

| Model | Firmware Version | Status |
|-------|------------------|--------|

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Home Assistant (version 2021.12 or newer recommended)
- USB-to-serial adapter or ser2net server for network connection
- Physical access to your heat pump's serial interface

### Installation Methods

#### Option 1: HACS (Recommended)

1. Ensure [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) is installed in your Home Assistant instance
2. Open HACS in your Home Assistant interface
3. Navigate to "Integrations"
4. Click the three dots in the top right corner and select "Custom repositories"
5. Add `https://github.com/bigbadoooff/thz` as a custom repository with category "Integration"
6. Search for "Stiebel Eltron LWZ / Tecalor THZ" in HACS
7. Click "Download" to install the integration
8. Restart Home Assistant

#### Option 2: Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/bigbadoooff/thz/releases)
2. Extract the `thz` folder from the archive
3. Copy the `thz` folder to your Home Assistant's `custom_components` directory
   - Path: `<config_dir>/custom_components/thz/`
   - If the `custom_components` directory doesn't exist, create it
4. Restart Home Assistant

### Configuration

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** in Home Assistant
2. Click the **"+ ADD INTEGRATION"** button
3. Search for **"Stiebel Eltron LWZ / Tecalor THZ Integration"**
